2. Within the Discord4bot folder run `npm ci`
3. To open Discord4bot run `npm start`

### If you have problem

If you encountered some problems try to delete Discord4bot folder and go trough installation again (you won't lose your settings). Its likely because of new Discord.js version. Discord4bot intended to run with 11.6.x version of Discord.js. You can check your Discord.js version with `npm list discord.js` command.

### Known Issues

* ~~Reaction entirely disappearing when you unreact them. Channel reload should show correctly reaction again.~~ It's working now, but dont do it fast. Can still depend on channel reloading.
